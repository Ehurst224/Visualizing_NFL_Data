# Visualizing_NFL_Data

#### On this site, you can navigate to three different analysis pages that will include statistics for players, teams, and positions. On the player analysis page you will be able to compare all player statistics. You may also narrow the player statistics by position. On the team analysis page, you can find a chart including each team's accumulated fantasy points. The position analysis page will allow you to look through total fantasy point distribution for each team by position and then by player. A full set of statistics can be found on the data tab.
